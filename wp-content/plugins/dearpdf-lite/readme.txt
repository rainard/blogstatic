= How many pages can PDF viewer support and how big the PDF file can be? =

DearPDF uses PDF.js to render the PDF pages. At any given time it requires only 6 pages of data at max. So the amount of pages in a PDF file doesn't really affect the viewer.
However, the vertical PDF viewer loads all pages, so it is not as efficient as flipbooks.
If partial loading is available in your server, it only loads 6 Pages of data to open the PDF and this makes it resource friendly and traffic friendly. Other PDF viewers might crash with huge files, DearPDF will last longer.
